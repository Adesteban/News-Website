						Efren "Bata" Reyes has apologized for the breach of health and safety protocols in the billiards event he attended last week.
					</p>

					<p class="gray">
						In a letter to the Games and Amusements Board (GAB), the sports legend explained what happened during the March 11 exhibition game in San Pedro, Laguna, where he was seen playing amid the pandemic.
					</p>

					<p class="gray">
						Reyes said he asked the organizers of the event to ask for permission from the local government before accepting their invitation.
					</p>

					<p class="gray">
						"The barangay captain was aware of the event," he said. "He kept on reminding the people watching the game to observe social distancing and follow the safety protocols."
					</p>

					<p class="gray">
						Reyes said "everything was smooth" at the beginning and there were only few viewers, but the news of his presence attracted more people from the neighborhood. It then became more difficult to enforce safety protocols.<br><br><br>

						"I am deeply sorry for what happened, I don't have control over the situation and the people around the vicinity," he said.<br><br><br>

						Reyes also clarified in a "24 Oras Weekend report that he was just reprimanded because of what happened.
